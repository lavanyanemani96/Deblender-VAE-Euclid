# Deblender-VAE-Euclid

This repository contains notebooks for deblending galaxy images for the upcoming Euclid survey in the VIS band. Two VAE networks are used to perform deblending. The first VAE (see ![notebook_vae_I](./I-VAE-Poisson-64x64.ipynb)) reconstructs isolated
galaxy images. The second VAE (see  ![notebook_vae_II](./II-VAE-Poisson-64x64.ipynb)
) uses the first VAEâ€™s decoder with fixed weights (which has
learnt to generate an isolated image from a latent space) and an encoder that tries to map the
blended galaxy input image to a point in latent space as though the galaxy in the centre of
the blended image were isolated, thus effectively reconstructing the real shape of the blended
object.
